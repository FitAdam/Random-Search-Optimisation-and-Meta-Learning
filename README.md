# Random Search Optimisation and Meta Learning :robot: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

**This is a project for the Concepts and Technologies of Artificial Intelligence class at University.**


The strategies such as Random Search, Meta Learning,
Adaptive Boosting, and Cascade Correlation were use to optimise the structure and parameters of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on a biometric data from yale's face images.
